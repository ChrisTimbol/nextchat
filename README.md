## Motivation 
I wanted to learn more about the backend and websockets/socket.io 

## What I Learned
- websockets  can make a quick low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between client and server
- socket.io to websockets is similar to how express framework is to node. That being that its an abstraction that makes the working with it easier
- I used a `nodemon` and `concurrently` npm packages for the first time. Nodemon made it easier to make adjustments on the backend without having to constantly restart the program. Concurrrently made it so i can run frontend and backend concurrently


## Framework/Libraries used
 Built with 
 - React 
 - NextJS 
 - Socket.io
 - Node
 - Express
